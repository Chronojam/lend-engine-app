                    <li>
                        <strong>Items with the same name are now placed into a 'product group'</strong> - any changes to one item in the group are made automatically to other items.
                        This excludes the item location, assignee, condition and serial number.
                    </li>
                    <li>Files uploaded as attachments are no longer renamed, which makes it easier for your members to choose the right file to download.</li>
                    <li>We've added lots more item types under "Health & Beauty" for medical and accessibility equipment.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>11th June 2019</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Upgraded booking process!</strong> We've made some minor but handy changes to the booking flow,
                        to speed things up and make it easier for new users. </li>
                    <li>
                        Calendars now show loans and bookings in the same colour that they appear elsewhere,
                        and for admins you can see the booking times as well as dates on the calendar.</li>
                    <li>The changes to the booking process now mean we support <strong>by-the-hour loans and reservations</strong>.
                        You can pick your own start and end times (restricted to site opening hours), or simply drag over cells in the week view
                    (turn on drag-to-book via the reservation settings page).</li>
                    <li>Member site now shows quantity available when grouping items by name (ie "2 of 4 available").</li>
                    <li>Item serial number is shown when checking in.</li>
                    <li>Item image upload file size has been increased to 5mb.</li>
                    <li>You can choose whether the calendar shows in month or week view by default.</li>
                    <li>Bug fix : inactive sites are no longer shown on the member site "find us" page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Batch update item locations</strong> (move or assign) from the admin item list.</li>
                    <li>Batch update condition, category, item fee and loan period from the item list.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>16th May 2019</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We've updated the loan search on the front end (member site) to make it easier to work with large numbers of loans.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>13th May 2019</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We've changed our billing plans, to add a top tier set of features for larger organisations.
                        It also includes a 'White label' option which removes all Lend Engine branding for your member
                        website and outgoing emails.</li>
                    <li><strong>Partial refunds</strong> are now possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>6th May 2019</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Print barcode labels</strong> for your items. Get started at Settings &raquo; Item barcode labels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>New report : Loan item detail</strong>. Show all items loaned, including fees, member information and check out/check in dates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We've added more detail to the loans list on the member screen, so you can see all the items
                        you lent to them, rather than just the list of loans.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When copying items, we now copy the images too - which should save a lot of time when creating lots of similar items.
                        Don't forget you can now also group items which have the same name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        New quick one-click access to all items which are assigned to you (from the items menu in admin).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>1st May 2019</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can now choose to <strong>group items with the same name</strong> on your member site.
                        Turn this on in your member site settings.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Upload your own site logo</strong>! Go to the member site page in settings.</li>
                    <li>We've moved the editor for site pages and menu links into the member site as part of the new
                        <strong>site edit mode</strong>. Here you can add extra pages (if you're on the Plus plan), rearrange pages
                    and (soon) choose from different website themes.</li>
                    <li>You can now add images to your HTML pages.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>25th April 2019</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Maximum per-file upload size has been increased from 2Mb to 5Mb.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When working with home page content and other HTML fields, you can now use a WYSIWYG editor.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>19th April 2019</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        New users can now choose from <strong>multiple self-serve membership types</strong> when registering online.
                        Previously, you could only set one self-serve membership type which was automatically applied to a member when they signed up.
                        Now you can set as many as you like for the new user to choose from, once they have confirmed their email address.
                        If a membership type requires payment, Lend Engine will prompt them for card details first.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We'll be working on adding all our supported languages to this new feature over the next few weeks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We've also added a "description" field to the membership type, which will help you guide your new members to the right choice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The same improvements have been made to the 'Change subscription' page reached from the user 'My account' page.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>15th April 2019</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fixed fee borrowing</strong> is a very handy new feature for libraries that don't charge per-day or per-week.
                    In your loan and reservation settings, just select "Prices are fixed per borrow" - easy! Available on all pay plans.</li>
                    <li>German is now available as a language to choose for your member site and emails.</li>
                    <li>You can now change the display order of item categories on your member site - see the item categories page in settings.</li>
                    <li>You can also change the display order of custom pages on your member site - see the custom page settings.</li>
                    <li>When printing your catalogue (from a category page as admin on the member site) you now have serial number and item price.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <p>17th October 2018</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We've added a <strong>new automated email</strong> to remind members of overdue items.
                            Just head along to settings and scroll down to see the 'Automation' section.
                        </li>
                    <li>
                        Like the other automated emails, you can edit the template too.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Email automation is now only available on our paid plans.
                    </li>
                        <li>
                            You now have a shiny new report to show <strong>non-loaned</strong> items, which you can use to help decide which items to remove from your library.
                            Check it out in the reports section of admin.
                        </li>
                    <li>
                        We've also added a new filter on the children report (for toy libraries).
                    </li>
                    </ul>

                <br>
                <p>24th August 2018</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We've added a major new feature; <strong>refundable deposits</strong>. If you're on the
                        standard plan or above, you can set up items to require a deposit when they are checked out.
                        Just choose the deposit amount on the item page. Different items can have different deposit amounts.
                        Staff can change the deposit amount on a per-loan basis if required.
                        The deposit is refundable, and will not affect the member account balance.
                        If you're using Stripe to take credit card payment, then the deposit refund is handled automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition to refundable deposits, we've added general refund capability.
                        No need to use negative payments any more. We've streamlined the checkout process into one page,
                        which should make it easier and quicker.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And last but not least, you can now choose Swedish for your member site.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p>
                    10th July 2018 : Bulk check-in items if none of the outstanding items have check-in prompts.
                    This should save loads of time when checking in multi-item loans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1st July 2018 : You can add a "changeover time" to your site opening hours if you want loans to run from and to different times from the opening and closing hours of the time slot.
                    Setting a changeover time will also allow reservations to start on the same day an item is due to be returned.<br>
                    Read more about the details of changeover times on the <a href="{{ path("site_list") }}">Site Settings screen</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    14th June 2018 : The member "subscribe to newsletter" field now shows in admin on the contact screen whether you have Mailchimp connected or not, and its value is included in the contact export CSV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    8th June 2018 : If you're on the Starter or Plus plan you can add custom Javascript to your member site, to manipulate fields and change behaviour. Be careful!
                </p>
                <p>
                    15th May 2018 : The default option when processing credit cards with Stripe is NOT to allow users to choose a previously used card.
                    Customers are created in Stripe when you take payments, in order that multiple payments for the same person appear on the same record,
                    but their card details are not presented in Lend Engine unless you turn on the setting to allow previously used cards.
                </p>

                <p>
                    8th May 2018 : We've added a new feature which allows you to add custom pages and links to your member site. This is available on Plus plan upwards.
                    See the menu item in the settings area to get started.
                </p>

                <p>
                    8th May 2018 : You can now make your member site private, so that users are required to log in before they can view items.
                    Public custom pages will still show. There's a new setting at the bottom of the main settings page to make your site private.
                </p>
